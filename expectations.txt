CMSC 100 - UV2L

The expectations I have for CMSC 100 is that 
I'd learn at least the web programming basics. 
I'm hoping that this course would help me become 
a better programmer, as well as learn more "trivial"
information regarding computer science as a discipline.
Furthermore, I'm looking forward to learning how to program
better in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Autriz, Mark Neil Comment : I agree that your expectations in this course will adhere to the knowledge and understanding that this course offers considering that it will allow to foster your information in web programming.
